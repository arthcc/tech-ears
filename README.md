# ✨ Tech Ears - From Developers to Developers

Tech Ears is an open-source project designed by developers for developers, aimed at enhancing English language skills and providing practice for technical questions and interviews. Our platform offers a collaborative environment where developers can improve their communication skills while preparing for the challenges of technical interviews.
